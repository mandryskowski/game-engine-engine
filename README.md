# My Game Engine Engine C++/OpenGL (26 Oct 2019 -> Now)

#### Features
- Actor & Component hierarchy
- Transformations system (local & world)
- Shader loading
- Model and Phong material loading
- Basic material system
- Phong lighting system + normal maps
- Shadow mapping for multiple lights (directional, spot or point)
- Parallax Occlusion Mapping
- Ugly SSAO
- FPS camera system
- Postprocessing - HDR, Gamma Correction and efficient gaussian blur
- SMAAT2x, velocity buffer could be useful for implementing per-pixel motion blur
- Basic PhysX integration (with built-in debug system)
- Primitive audio engine using OpenAL Soft; you can only load .wav files for now
- Interpolation system for simple animation
- Some utility classes for future development

**TODO:**
1. PBR Shading (with light probe generation for IBL)
2. Skeletal animation system
3. .ogg loading
4. Possibly add about some audio engine that is usable and affordable
