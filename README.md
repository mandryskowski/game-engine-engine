## Hello!
I am a 16 year old polish developer learning OpenGL. After one year of gaining experience in the library, I've decided to go one step further and create my own somewhat-functional 3D engine!



# Prefix Engine C++/OpenGL (26 Oct 2019 -> Now)

#### First version   0.1
- Actor & Component hierarchy
- Transformations system (local & world)
- Shader loading
- No sane mesh loader yet; the engine can only load my own file format *.fware*
- Basic material system
- Phong lighting system + normal maps
- Parallax Occlusion Mapping
- FPS camera system
- Collision engine with wall sliding (spheres, cubes and points)
- Postprocessing - HDR, Gamma Correction and efficient gaussian blur
- Some utility classes for future development

**TODO:**
1. Repair some stuff!
2. Sound system
3. Shadows (or if you like fancy names, Omnidirectional Shadow Mapping)
4. Implement loading popular 3D model formats (preferably with Assimp)
5. Wonder if lighting should be done in view or world space
